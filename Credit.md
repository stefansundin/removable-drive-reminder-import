# Introduction #

Removable Drive Reminder is developed by Stefan Sundin. You can visit my website at [stefansundin.com](http://stefansundin.com).

This program was inspired by [Flash Drive Reminder](http://www.bgreco.net/reminder.php). I needed to have an installable version (on the computer rather than the USB stick), but Brad Greco told me that he had unfortunately lost the source code. So I decided to start out from scratch.

The icon comes from the [Human-O2 icon set](http://schollidesign.deviantart.com/art/Human-O2-Iconset-105344123) by schollidesign (GPL).

Removable Drive Reminder is a program that alerts you if you forgot to remove your USB stick when you log out or shutdown the computer.

This program is intended to help you save money, by not having to purchase yet another USB stick, and prevent theft (of both your USB stick and your files), by not giving anyone the opportunity.

Microsoft has disabled the autorun option for USB drives on WinXP, Vista and Windows 7. This means that if you choose to install to a USB drive, you have to make sure to launch the program manually. Therefore, this program might be best suited to be installed on public machines by administrators.

## Current features ##
  * Portable (installer supports install to USB)
  * Supports safely remove hardware wizard (this means that if you run the program from a USB drive, you can use the wizard without first having to exit the program)
  * Works great on WinXP, Vista, Win7 and Win8 (tested on developer preview). May work on earlier versions but this isn't something I have tested.
  * Discrete; it does what it is supposed to do without bothering you otherwise
  * Optional audible alert

## TODO ##
  * Capability to monitor removable hard drives.
